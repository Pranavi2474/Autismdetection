autism detection in adults 

Autism Detection in Adults is a machine learning and deep learning-based
project aimed at identifying signs of autism in adults. The model uses a 
multimodal approach, combining both numerical data (such as questionnaire 
responses and demographics) and image data like heatmaps and spectrograms.
These image features are generated from behavioral or physiological 
signals, which help the model learn patterns linked to autistic traits.


The image data is processed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
 while the numerical data is handled by a traditional machine learning 
model or a dense neural network. By merging predictions from both types 
of data, the system achieves improved accuracy. The final output 
indicates whether autism is likely to be present, along with an optional
 confidence score.


Users can interact with the system through a Jupyter Notebook,
 where they upload spectrogram and heatmap images for analysis. Once the
 models are loaded, the notebook runs the prediction and displays the 
result in a simple, user-friendly format. This makes it easy for 
researchers or healthcare professionals to test new data without complex
 setup.


The project is developed in Python and uses libraries like TensorFlow,
scikit-learn, OpenCV, and Matplotlib.It is open-source and can be further 
improved with features like real-time input, mobile integration, or deployment
as a web application.Contributions and feedback are welcome to help expand its 
functionality and usability.
